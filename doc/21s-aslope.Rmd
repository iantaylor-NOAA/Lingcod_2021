### \acrlong{s-aslope}


The \gls{s-aslope} operated during the months of October to November aboard the R/V _Miller Freeman_.
Partial survey coverage of the US west coast occurred during the years 1988-1996 and complete coverage (north of 34\textdegree 30\textquotesingle S) during the years 1997 and 1999-2001.
Typically, only these four years that are seen as complete surveys are included in assessments.

Sample sizes of `r spp` were low during these four complete years, with 119 samples across
55 tows coastwide. Given that `r spp` are primarily a shelf species, data from this
survey was not included in the model. 

[I DONT KNOW WHETHER THE NWFSC SLOPE SURVEYS ARE THE SAME AS AFSC SLOPE. SO NEED
TO ADD DETAILS]

The NWFSC also operated a slope survey during the years 1998-2002. Coastwide, 184
`r spp` were sampled across 64 tows. Data from this survey were not included in
the model for the same reasons why data from the \gls{s-aslope} were not included.
