### Oregon

The recreational fishery in Oregon likely began in the early 1950s or 1960s
but data on catches prior to
`r min(data_catch %>% dplyr::filter(fleet == "OR") %>% dplyr::pull("Year"))`
are not available.
ODFW provided the time series of catches that includes information on
shoreside activities, estuary boats, private ocean boats, and charter ocean boats.
**todo: get a written description of methods from Ali @kellijohnson-noaa**
