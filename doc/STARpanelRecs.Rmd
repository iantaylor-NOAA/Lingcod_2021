<!-- Most recent STAR panel and SSC recommendations -->

The 2017 STAR report [**to do cite report**] noted 4 Unresolved Problems, 
3 Major Uncertainties, and provided 3 specific recommendations for future 
research from the most recent full stock assessment @haltuch_2017_2018. 
The four Unresolved Problems were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item The models did not use the available age data sampled from the 
  fishing fleets due to concerns that unsexed fish had been assigned equally 
  to the sexes without regard to length and because of evidence there had 
  been non-random subsampling of fish for age-reading.
  
  \item The available age-readings had been done by at least two laboratories. 
  It was unclear that age-reading protocols had been employed consistently
  
  \item In the northern model the STAT fixed the parameter for female length 
  at age 14 years because when this parameter was freely estimated the model 
  estimated asymptotic selection for the trawl fishery and greatly altered 
  the estimates of spawning biomass. It was unclear what data sources were 
  responsible for this result.
  
  \item Sensitivity analyses for draft versions of both models indicated 
  they were sensitive to underlying structural assumptions such as the starting 
  year for recruitment deviations and which indices were included. Although 
  the revisions to the models developed during the STAR may have lessened the 
  sensitivity of the models by removing sources of tension and keeping the more 
  reliable data, there was not sufficient time during the review to explore the 
  sensitivity of the final base models.
  
\end{enumerate}

All Unresolved Problems were addressed during this assessment. 

Unresolved problem #1 was addressed by exploring the use of age data as conditioned 
on length for sexed `r spp`, though unsexed fish were excluding with CAAL data. 

[**currently nwfscSurvey methodology does not include unsexed fish. This could be overcome
based on the create_caal_nonsurvey.R script. May wish to state here the amount of unsexed 
aged fish - and whether it was high or not. Regardless, sexed fish is a good start**]

Unresolved problem #2 was address by conducting additional analysis
on ageing error among readers. This is described in detail in 
[Ageing Error](ageing-precision-and-bias) section.

Unresolved problem #3 [**to do add more based on model exploration**]

Unresolved problem #4 is a general issue of stock assessment modeling, 
and not unique to `r spp`. We explored a number of sensitivities 
excluding data sources and reconciling data conflicts.
