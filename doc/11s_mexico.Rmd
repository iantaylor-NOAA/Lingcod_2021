### Mexico

`r Spp` are known to inhabit waters off the coast of Mexico as far south as
Punta San Carlos, Baja California
([https://mexican-fish.com/lingcod/](https://mexican-fish.com/lingcod/)).

The [Declaration For Entry Into California of Game, Fish, Birds Or Animals](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Enforcement/Entry-Declaration)
represents a potential future source of information for documenting
catches that occur off the coast of Mexico but are landed in California.
Anglers are required to fill out the report prior to entering US waters
but it is not clear if this information is currently included in RecFIN.
