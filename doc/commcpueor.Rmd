#### Oregon nearshore logbook index

\Glsentrylong{odfw} has required nearshore
permitted vessels and open access vessels within the commercial fishery
to submit fishing logbooks since 2004.
Compliance is generally high, averaging around 80\% but has varied through
time, ranging from 65\% in 2007 to greater than 90\% in recent years.
Although required to provide all requested information in the logbook per
fishing-gear set,
there has been substantial variation in the quantity and quality
of information reported in logbooks. The logbook database contains
information on catch by species (number or pounds of retained and released
fish), effort (hook hours), sample location (port), date, vessel, fishing
depth, fishing gear, fishing permit, number of fishers, and harvest trip
limits.

This logbook information went through multiple data-quality filters to attain the
best possible consistent and representative data set to estimate
a relative abundance trend (Table \@ref(tab:cpue-commercialfixed-gear-filter)).
Individual observations of catch and effort were at the trip level,
and multi-set trips were aggregated to the trip level.
\Glsentrylong{cpue} was calculated for each trip, where total
catch was defined as the total of all reported, retained catch (in weight) and
released catch (numbers converted to weight by applying median catch
weight) and total effort was defined by hook-hours (number of hooks used
multiplied by the number of hours fished). The full data set included data
from 38,350 trips from 2004 â€“ 2020.
Encounter rates for `r spp` were relatively high and, in general,
data filters that were applied focused on
eliminating records with missing or unrealistic values, including
permitted trips using only hook-and-line jig gear from ports with appreciable
data, and using only vessels that fished in at least three years over the
logbook history. Vessel operators may have changed through time as the filter
was tied to the vessel name only. Gear type was restricted to hook-and-line
only (excluding longline gear) because this gear type accounts for the vast
majority of trips for `r spp` (approximately 78.5\% of unfiltered dataset).
Ports retained in the data were Port Orford, Gold Beach, and Brookings as
these ports are where most commercially caught `r spp` are landed. With the
exception of the vessel fishing for a minimum of three years and the
abnormally deep trips, these filters are consistent with the most recent
`r spp` assessment [@haltuch2019lingcod]. These two filters were used for
development of the Oregon nearshore logbook index in the most recent cabezon
assessment [@cope2019cabezon] and were retained here at the recommendation of
\gls{odfw} staff.

Covariates considered included month, vessel, port, depth, and person.
Two-month periods associated with commercial trip limits were also considered
but were excluded due to multicollinearity with month. All covariates were
specified as factors, except depth was a continuous variable. Depth was
included to account for general differences in bathymetry and fishing depth
restrictions. People were included to try to control for the potential
oversaturation of hooks at a given fishing location and the interaction that
multi-crew trips (number of fishers onboard) may have on fishing efficiency.
Accounting for vessel also accounts for variability in fishing capacity.

\Glsentrylong{cpue} was modeled using a delta-\gls{glm} approach,
where the catch occurrence
(binomial) component was modeled using a logit link function and the log of
the positive catch component was modeled according to a Gaussian distribution
with an identity link function. The selection of covariates included in the final
models were evaluated using standard information criterion for relative
goodness of fit (\gls{aic} and \gls{bic}), where a covariate remained in the model if
model fit was improved relative to an otherwise identical model without the
covariate.
<!--(Table \@ref(tab:OR-COMM-NSLOG-CPUE-model-selection)).-->
Model selection of all
main effects identified the full model with covariates month, vessel, port,
depth and people as the best fit to the data, along with the year factor of
interest for the index. Residuals from the binomial component of the delta
model are not expected to be normally distributed, so quantile residuals were
simulated [@dunn1996] using the R package DHARMa [@hartig2021]. A
quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the simulated residuals suggests that the
binomial component of the delta-model is a reasonable approximation of the
data (Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-commercialfixed-gearqqbin)).
However, as observed with the Oregon ORBS
\gls{cpue} index, there were issues noted in the DHARMa simulated residuals,
including curvature and significant outlier tests, for the positive component
of the model (Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-commercialfixed-gearqqpos)).
These were confirmed with standard
diagnostic tools for \glspl{glm}.
Despite filtering procedures described above, it
was noted that there were a wide range of positive \gls{cpue} values, which results
in a heavy left skew in the log(\gls{cpue}) values. Multiple alternative
distributions and more parsimonious models for the positive model were
explored, as well as aggressive filters for outliers, but did not
substantially improve diagnostics.

A Bayesian delta-\gls{glm} modelling framework, rstanrm [@rstanarm2020],
was used to estimate the uncertainty
while accounting for the correlation structure between parameters within the
two components of the model, as well as with the combined delta-model.
The models were implement using diffuse priors and largely matched
the results of \gls{mle} frameworks.
The advantage of this approach is that the calculation of the index
(summing relevant model parameters and combining model components) can be
done using the posterior draws, preserving the correlation structure and
propagating uncertainty into the final index. As
an additional diagnostic, replicate datasets were generated from the
posterior predictive distribution, and compared the \gls{mle}
from the model components to the median estimates from the
posterior distribution. As expected with the above diagnostics, the binomial
model closely matches the distribution from replicate datasets; however,
there are some deviations with the positive model. \Gls{mle} were virtually
identical to the medians of the posterior distributions in both cases,
however.
