#### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 - 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast.
Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.

Three sources of information are produced from the \Gls{s-wcgbt}: an index of relative
abundance, length-frequency distributions, and age-frequency distributions. Length-weight 
parameters were also estimated from data collected from the \Gls{s-wcgbt}, and details are
described in Section {\ref biology}.

#### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977, and the survey continued until 2004 [@weinberg_2001_2002].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east-to-west transects across the continential shelf from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 were conducted from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey was conducted from mid July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June through late August.
The 1998 survey was conducted from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted from May to July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
Due to haul performance issues and truncated sampling with respect to depth, the data from 1977 were omitted from this analysis.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the US West Coast south to 36.8\textdegree N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to 34.5\textdegree N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to 34.5\textdegree N.
In 2004, the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey following similar protocols to earlier years.

The triennial data have historically been split into early (1980-1992) 
and late (1995-2004) survey time series and treated independently, however
for this assessment we combined across time series into a single fleet.
Splitting the triennial survey into two time series was explored as a 
sensitivity.

#### NWFSC Hook and Line Survey

[NEED TO COMFIRM WITH HARMS THIS WRITE UP IS APPROPRIATE FOR LINGCOD. I BORROWED FROM COPPER ROCKFISH SOUTH WRITE UP]

Since 2004, the NWFSC has conducted an annual hook and line survey targeting shelf rockfish in the genus Sebastes at fixed stations in the Southern California Bight. Key species of rockfish targeted by the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey are bocaccio (*S. paucispinis*), cowcod (*S. levis*), greenspotted (*S. chlorostictus*), and vermilion (*S. miniatus* and *S. crocotulus*) rockfishes, although a wide range of groundfish species have been observed by this survey. Starting in 2014 the NWFSC Hook and Line Survey added sampling sites located within the cowcod conservation area (CCA).

During each site visit, three deckhands simultaneously deploy 5-hook sampling rigs (this is referred to as a single drop) for a maximum of 5 minutes per line, but individual lines may be retrieved sooner at the anglerâ€™s discretion (e.g., to avoid losing fish). Five drops are attempted at each site for a maximum possible catch of 75 fish per site per year (3 anglers x 5 hooks x 5 drops). Further details regarding the sample frame, site selection, and survey methodology are described by Harms et al. [-@harms_noaa_2008].
