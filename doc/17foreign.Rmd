## Foreign Fisheries

### Alaska

`r Spp` fisheries in the Gulf of Alaska are managed
in state waters by the State of Alaska Board of Fisheries and
in federal waters by the \gls{npfmc}.
Commercial fisheries are restricted by catch and bycatch quotas.
The sport fishery is restricted by daily bag and possession limits.
Lingcod are a non-target species in the subsistence fishery.
No formal assessment exists for `r spp` in Alaskan waters.

### Canada

`r Spp` in western Canada are managed under the \gls{bcigfp}
by \gls{dfo} for take by
First Nations, the commercial sector, and the recreational sector.
Beginning in 1997,
the \gls{bcigfp} implemented an individual vessel quota program
that now incorporates all commercially caught trawl and hook-and-line groundfish.
Stocks in distinct management areas are regularly assessed,
with the most recent assessment of `r spp`
in outer British Columbia waters ocurring in 2011 [@bcstockassessment2011] and
**todo - need citation**
in the Strait of Georgia in 2014 [@DFO2016].

**todo - edit / add to the following two paragraphs**
The 2011 outer British Columbia assessment implemented a
Bayesian surplus production model to assess
the status of `r spp` in four assessment areas.
Overall the stock appears to have
remained stable between 1927-1970,
declined until 1980,
increased until 1990, and
has continued to decline since then.
However, at no time has the stock been estimated
to have been below target reference points.

The 2016 assessment [@bcstockassessment2016]
implemented a two-sex Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model.
The estimated spawning biomass in 2014 was greater than
the estimated spawning biomass at the start of the current management regime during 2006 and
that the stock is likely in a precautionary management zone.

### Mexico

`r Spp` are known to inhabit waters off the coast of Mexico as far south as
Punta San Carlos, Baja California
([https://mexican-fish.com/lingcod/](https://mexican-fish.com/lingcod/)).

Southern California recreational fishers have reported fishing in
Mexican waters and landing fish in U.S. ports.
The [Declaration For Entry Into California of Game, Fish, Birds Or Animals](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Enforcement/Entry-Declaration)
represents a potential future source of information for documenting
catches that occur off the coast of Mexico but are landed in California.
Anglers are required to fill out the report prior to entering U.S. waters
but it is not clear if this information is currently included in RecFIN.

** todo - check in with Hem if she has received any information**
There are no known stock assessments for `r spp` off the coast of Mexico.
