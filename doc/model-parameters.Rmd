### Estimated Parameters

A full list of all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Table XXX. 

```{r parameters, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# get parameter names from base model
estimated_pars <- model$parameters %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Active_Cnt)) %>%
  rownames()
```

The base model has a total of `r length(estimated_pars)` estimated parameters 
in the following categories:

- 2 natural mortality parameters (female and male $M$)
- 10 growth parameters, where females and males each had
  - 3 von Bertalanffy parameters (length at age 0.5, length at age 14, and $k$)
  - 2 parameters controlling variability in growth, the CV in length at age 0.5
  and the CV in length at age 14 with a linear ramp in length-at-age.
- `r 2 + nrow(model$recruit)` recruitment parameters
  - $log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment
  - $h$ controlling the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship
  - `r nrow(model$recruit)` recruitment deviations parameters covering the range
  `r min(model$recruit$Yr)`-`r max(model$recruit$Yr)`, with 
  `r min(model$recruit$Yr[model$recruit$era=="Main"])`-`r max(model$recruit$Yr[model$recruit$era=="Main"])`
  representing the "main" period modeled as a zero-centered deviation vector.
- `r sum(sum(grepl("Q_extra", estimated_pars)))` extra standard deviation parameters
for indices
- `r sum(grepl("Size_DblN", estimated_pars))` selectivity parameters of which
`r sum(grepl("Size_DblN.*BLK", estimated_pars))` represented changes over time
- `r sum(sum(grepl("Retain", estimated_pars)))` retention parameters all of which
represented changes over time since the retention prior to 1998 was assumed to be
high for all selected fish.

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Table XXX.

### Fixed Parameters

Commercial fishery retention parameters for the period prior to 1998 were
fixed at values that led to almost 100\% retention.
