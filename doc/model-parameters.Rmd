### Priors

The prior distributions for female and male natural mortality were based on
the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum
age of 18 and 13 years old for females and males, respectively.

The prior distribution for steepness was based on the prior distribution used
in the assessment of Pacific Hake, _Merluccius productus_ [@JTC2021],
which is based on the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles (0.67, 0.79, and 0.87, respectively)
from Myers et al. [@myers1999]. The prior has a beta distribution given the following
parameters: 9.76 and 2.80, which translates to a mean of 0.777 and a log-standard
deviation of 0.113. This prior has been used for Pacific Hake since 2007.
The terms of reference for groundfish managed by the \gls{pfmc} suggest that priors
on steepness should have a mean of 0.72 and a standard deviation of 0.16.
An analysis from [FishLife](github.com/James-Thorson/FishLife) suggested a prior
with a mean of 0.67 and a standard deviation of 0.22.

### Estimated parameters

```{r parameters, include = FALSE, eval = TRUE, cache = TRUE}
# get parameter names from base model
estimated_pars <- model$parameters %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(Active_Cnt)) %>%
  rownames()
```

The base model has a total of `r length(estimated_pars)` estimated parameters 
in the following categories:

- 2 natural mortality parameters (female and male $M$)
- 10 growth parameters, where females and males each had
  - 3 von Bertalanffy parameters (length at age 0.5, length at age 14, and $k$)
  - 2 parameters controlling variability in growth, the CV in length at age 0.5
  and the CV in length at age 14 with a linear ramp in length-at-age.
- `r 2 + nrow(model$recruit)` recruitment parameters
  - $log(R_0)$ controlling equilibrium recruitment
  - $h$ controlling the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship
  - `r nrow(model$recruit)` recruitment deviations parameters covering the range
  `r min(model$recruit$Yr)`-`r max(model$recruit$Yr)`, with 
  `r min(model$recruit$Yr[model$recruit$era=="Main"])`-`r max(model$recruit$Yr[model$recruit$era=="Main"])`
  representing the "main" period modeled as a zero-centered deviation vector
- `r sum(sum(grepl("Q_extra", estimated_pars)))` extra standard deviation parameters
for indices
- `r sum(grepl("Size_DblN", estimated_pars))` selectivity parameters of which
`r sum(grepl("Size_DblN.*BLK", estimated_pars))` represented changes over time
- `r sum(sum(grepl("Retain", estimated_pars)))` retention parameters all of which
represented changes over time because the retention prior to 1998 was assumed to be
high for all selected fish

The estimated parameters are described in greater detail below and a full list of 
all estimated and fixed parameters is provided in Table \@ref(tab:).

[**TO DO: add more detail here**]

### Fixed parameters

Commercial fishery retention parameters for the period prior to 1998 were
fixed at values that led to almost 100\% retention.

[**TO DO: if north 2021.n.020.001 is the base model,
describe the reasons for fixing 3 selectivity parameters that were hitting the bounds]
