The time series of recreational catches in terms of numbers of fish
were provided by \gls{wdfw} and
include information on fishing within Washington's coastal areas sampled by the
Ocean Sampling Program in Marine Areas 1-4.
Catches within the northern-most area, Marine Area 4,
that were landed within the Strait of Juan de Fuca, i.e.,
Bonilla-Tatoosh line to the mouth of the Sekiu River and sampled by the
Puget Sound Sampling Program, but caught within the coastal areas were also included.

Numbers of fish were translated into weights (mt) to
standardize inputs across the recreational fleets and
increase the ease of comparing outputs.
**todo( #30): document how numbers were transcribed to mt**
