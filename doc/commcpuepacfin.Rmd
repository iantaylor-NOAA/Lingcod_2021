#### PacFIN trawl logbook index

A commercial trawl CPUE index was retained from the previous assessment.
The index spans the years 1981-1997, with the end point chosen prior 
to significant changes in management beginning in 1998. A detailed description
of the index standardization approach is available in 
Haltuch et al. [-@haltuch_2017_2018]. The index was developed on a coastwide
scale using VAST and post-stratified to produce separate indices for the 
north and south stocks. For this assessment the stratification was updated 
to reflect the new boundary at $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N without changing 
the underlying index standardization (pers. comm., J. Wallace, \gls{nwfsc}).
