#### PacFIN trawl logbook index

A commercial trawl CPUE index was retained from the previous assessment.
The index spans the years 1981-1997, with the end point chosen prior 
to significant changes in management beginning in 1998. A detailed description
of the index standardization approach is available in 
Haltuch et al. [-@haltuch2019lingcod]. The index was developed on a coastwide
scale using VAST and post-stratified to produce separate indices for the 
north and south stocks. For this assessment the stratification was updated 
to reflect the new boundary at \CapeM without changing 
the underlying index standardization (pers. comm., J. Wallace, \gls{nwfsc}).
