#### \Glsentrylong{orbs} index

Trip-level catch-per-unit-effort data from \gls{orbs} dockside sampling was
obtained from \gls{odfw} on 04/15/2021. To mitigate the confounding of hourly
effort associated with these trips with travel, the travel time was
subtracted from the hours fished. Travel time was stratified by boat type
(charter and private) and was calculated as boat type-specific speeds (13 mph
for charter boat trips and 18 mph for private boat trips) multiplied by twice
the distance between the port of origin and the reef that was fished. CPUE,
expressed in terms of fish per angler-hour, was calculated by multiplying the
number of anglers and the adjusted travel time. The database contains
information on catch by species (number of retained fish), effort
(angler hours), sample location (port where data were collected), date, bag
limits, boat type (charter or private), and trip type (e.g., bottom
associated fish).

##### Data preparation, filtering, and sample sizes

The unfiltered data set contained 411,528 trips. Multiple standardized filters
are applied to \gls{orbs} trip-level data in order to remove outliers and
data unsuitable for an index (Table \@ref(tab:cpue-recreationalOregon-filter)).
These filters include trips with incorrect interview times, which impact
calculation of effort, unreasonably long or short trips, and retaining only
trips targeting bottom fish. Further filters were utilized for fishing closures
(i.e., temporal or spatial closures) and catches exceeding bag limits, which
would presumably impact catch rates. Trips from several ports with extremely
small sample sizes were also excluded and, finally, trips that met criteria
for irrational effort reporting (i.e., implausible values) or extreme catch
rates were excluded as well. Also, all trips from private vessels were removed
and only trips from charter boats were retained to increase the positivity
rate of `r spp` encounters.
As described below, this filter was one of several explored to
improve model fit. To identify trips that were likely to catch `r spp`,
Stephens and MacCall [@stephens2004] filtering was used to
predict the probability of catching a
`r spp` given the occurrence of other species in the catch.
This filter was recently used in the development of an
\gls{orbs} \gls{cpue} index of abundance for
the 2019 Cabezon assessment [@cope2019cabezon]. However, there was some
question about whether it was appropriate for use with `r spp`.
Thus, the model was estimated using data that was both filtered and
not filtered with the Stephens-MacCall filter.
Filtering the data did not change the model diagnostics, and thus, it
was not utilized for the final data set.

##### Standardization: model selection, fits, and diagnostics

A delta-\gls{glm} approach was used to model \gls{cpue}. Apart
from differences in catch rate among years, we also considered changes
associated with month, mega-region (north and south coasts, divided at the
port of Florence on the central Oregon coast), port, season (summer and
winter), the bag limit for `r spp`, and the depths available to the
recreational fleet for fishing (Figure “ORBS_DataSummary”). The binomial
component for catch occurrence was modeled using a logit link function while
the log of positive \gls{cpue} was modeled with a Gaussian distribution and an
identity link function. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and other factors described
below, the binomial model selected as the best predictor of \gls{orbs} catch
rates included year, port, month and open depths available to fishing
(Table “OR_ORBS_CPUE_model_selection”). Season and mega-region were also
evaluated but not included in the stepwise progression due to collinearity
with other factors (month and port, respectively). Interactions between year
and port, month and open depths were also evaluated.  Models with
interactions between year and port or month did not converge due to missing
trips in some strata and these were excluded from consideration.  Residuals
from the binomial component of the delta-model are not expected to be
normally distributed, so quantile residuals were simulated using the R
package DHARMa [@hartig2021]. A quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the simulated
residuals suggests that the binomial component of the delta-model is a
reasonable approximation of the data (Figure “ScaledQQplot_bin”, right
panel); however, there was some curvature seen in the residuals
(left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-recreationalOregonqqbin)).
These diagnostics were
substantially improved by excluding the year:open depths interaction and the
removal of the private boat trips from the dataset. The positive model
selected, again based on AIC, BIC and other considerations, included year,
port, month and open depths available to fishing
(Table \@ref(tab:OR_ORBS_CPUE_model_selection)).
Again, there were issues noted in
the DHARMa simulated residuals, including curvature and significant outlier
tests (Figure \@ref(fig:cpue-recreationalOregonqqpos)).
However, as noted with the binomial
model, these were improved slightly, though not resolved, by exclusion of
any interaction terms and the removal of the private vessel trips. There was
insufficient time to fully resolve these diagnostic issues and alternative
approaches may need to be explored for future assessments. Given that
mega-region was not included in this model selection procedure, an
area-weighted model was not utilized for `r spp`, as has been used for other
nearshore species in recent assessments, such as cabezon [@cope2019cabezon]
or blue rockfish [@dick2018bluedeacon].

To estimate the uncertainty in the final index of abundance, it is necessary
to account for the correlation structure between parameters within the
binomial and lognormal components of the model, as well as with the combined
(binomial and lognormal components) delta-model.
The rstanarm package in R [@rstanarm2020]
was used to replicate the best models using diffuse prior distributions that
replicated point estimates from the \gls{mle}. The advantage of
this approach is that the calculation of the index (summing relevant model
parameters and combining model components) can be applied to posterior draws,
preserving the correlation structure and propagating uncertainty into the
final index (Figure \@ref(fig:)). As an
additional diagnostic, replicate datasets were generated from the posterior
predictive distribution, and compared the \glspl{mle}
from the model components to the median estimates from the posterior
distribution. As expected with the above diagnostics, the binomial model
closely matches the distribution from replicate datasets; however, there are
some deviations with the positive model. \Gls{mle} were virtually identical to the
medians of the posterior distributions in both cases, however.
