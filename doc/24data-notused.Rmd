#### Fin rays from \glsentrylong{cdfw}

The \gls{cdfw} collected `r utils_name("common")` fin rays from the
commercial and recreational fisheries in recent years and cleaned them in
preparation for ageing, but restrictions on access to ageing laboratories to
use saws to thin section and mount them for ageing prevented their inclusion
in this assessment.
\Gls{cdfw} conducted a commercial sampling project
from February through June 2019 to acquire samples for priority species from
Crescent City to Santa Barbara, resulting in 113 `r utils_name("common")` fin
rays for ageing. The majority of samples were landed utilizing hook-and-line
gear, though some trawl-caught samples were also obtained. In addition to age
structures, meta data includes port of landing, gear type, length,
weight, sex, and maturity. In 2017, \gls{cdfw} began opportunistically collecting
groundfish carcasses from the recreational fishery to increase recreational
biological data by collecting filleted groundfish carcasses from partnering
\gls{cpfv} operators and at public fillet stations, launch ramps, and piers.
Current efforts have been primarily focused in the Crescent City and Monterey Bay
port complexes as well as samples from south of Point Conception in
collaboration with the Sportfishing Association of California, yielding a
total of 324 `r utils_name("common")` fin rays.  In addition to age
structures, meta data includes port of landing, carcass length, and sex
when it can be determined from the filleted carcass. A graduate student at
California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo is working on a study of
total length to carcass length for recreational species, including rockfish
and `r utils_name("common")`, results of which will help inform the best
treatment of length information attained from carcasses. These samples may
be used to inform growth, create conditional-age-at-length data, or to supplement
samples from other sampling programs used to represent age composition
directly in future assessments.
