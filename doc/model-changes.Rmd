### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

In addition to the re-analysis of all data sources and the change in 
boundary between north and south, the following changes were made to the 
modeling approach in the previous assessments:
- Separate natural mortality priors for males and females based on a lower
maximum age (18 for females, 13 for males, compared to 21 for both sexes)
- New age-based maturity estimates for each area
- Update weight-length relationship to include additional samples
- Fix the $\sigma_R$ = 0.6 for both models (in 2017 had been iteratively 
tuned to 0.55 for the north model and 0.75 for the south)
- In the *south* model, separate the "DebWV" CPFV index and associated 
length composition into a separate fleet to provide independent selectivity
parameters to account for this data source sampling both discarded and 
retained catch whereas the rest of the 
California recreational catch is modeled as retained catch only
- In the *north* model, add selectivity parameters for the California
recreational fishery
- Turn off male offsets on selectivity to simplify the model
- Estimate 3 double-normal selectivity parameters within each time block
for each fleet (whereas the previous model had fewer or more parameters
estimated depending on the fleet or time block)
- Fix the retention parameters for the early period of the commercial 
TW and FG fisheries to retain all selected fish prior to 1998
- Revise the blocking on numerous selectivity parameters
- Treat the Triennial survey as a continuous time-series rather than 
two separate fleets with independent catchability and selectivity parameters
- Use a newer version of Stock Synthesis version 3.30.17.01 (although
comparison indicates very little impact of the change in version)
