<!-- Commercial length- and age-frequency data -->

Length and age compositions from commercial landings 
for the TW and FG fleets were developed 
from the PacFIN database using the PacFIN.Utilities R package (
https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/PacFIN.Utilities/).

The majority of the available length and age data were from the northern area,
reflecting the larger commercial catches of `r spp` in the north and the 
larger commercial sampling and ageing programs employed by \gls{wdfw} and \gls{odfw}.

Length and age distributions from west coast groundfish commercial fisheries
are typically expanded to account for variability in the number of fish sampled
per trip relative to the total catch. This allows greater weight given to samples
from a very large trip compared to one with a small catch. However,
the commercial data for `r spp`, as represented in the PacFIN database,
have a large fraction of trips without trip weights. This leads to
large variability in the expanded sample sizes among trips and implausible amounts
of variability in the resulting composition data among length bins within a given
fleet and year. Unexpanded data did not show this variability, so the base models
used only unexpanded composition data for the commercial fisheries.

Commercial TW length-composition data started in 1965 in the north and 
1977 in the south. Commercial FG length compositions 
began in 1986 in the north with additional samples in 1971, 1980, 
and 1982 and began in 1992 in the south with additional samples in 1988 and 1989.

Commercial age samples covered a much wider range of years than the south, 
with annual age samples from all 43 years starting in 1978 for TW and 35 years 
starting in 1986 for FG. In the south model, the only commercial TW ages were 
from 10 years within the range 1993 to 2004 and only 2 years of commercial FG 
ages were available: 1993 and 1994. The commercial age data was processed as
both marginal and conditional age-at-length data to allow explorations of either
format in the models (see "CompDat" in electronic appendix for figures showing 
the age data from commercial fisheries")

Unsexed fish were represented as separate composition vectors in addition to the 
compositions of fish with known sex.
The number of trips was used as the input sample size for all commercial 
composition data. 
Table \ref{tab:sample-size-length} show the sample sizes for lengths, 
and Table \ref{tab:sample-size-age} the sample sizes for ages.
```{asis, opts.label = 'north', echo = TRUE}
Sample sizes by state aggregated across sexes are provided in 
Table \ref{tab:sample-size-length-byState} for lengths and
Table \ref{tab:sample-size-age-byState} for ages.
```

Length compositions and mean body weight observations were also available 
from commercial discards for the years 2004 to 2019. These observations were 
all unsexed and represented in the model as independent vectors to facilitate
estimation of retention functions for the TW and FG fleets. The mean body weight
observations were calculated from counted baskets of discarded fish and represented
a larger number of individuals that the subsamples from which lengths were available,
but in general they provide similar information 
(Figures \ref{fig:discard-fitcommercialtrawl}-\ref{fig:bodywt-fit-fltcommercialfixed-gear})
