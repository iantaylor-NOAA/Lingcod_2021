#### Lander data

\Gls{odfw} provided density estimates and a range of estimated population
abundances from underwater video lander data for
`r utils_name("common")`.
The lander data was collected over nine years by \gls{odfw}
[@rasmuson2020]. The data includes information from
ten independent studies carried out in both nearshore rocky reefs
coastwide, as well as select reef structures offshore of the central coast of
Oregon. Underwater video landers are stationary platforms consisting of one
to three video cameras. Landers used in deeper water employ advanced
lighting systems for optimal viewing of fish and benthic habitat. Ambient
light is used in shallow surveys. The variability in detection range by
depth is an important factor to consider when deriving fish density from
lander data. Therefore, a series of abundance estimates were provided to
inform this assessment. Methods are summarized below and a more detailed
document is available by \gls{odfw} upon request.

Variability in range, and therefore area viewed, directly influences fish
abundance. Thus, density estimates were calculated using five
estimates of range. These include the average range, the range +/- one
standard deviation from the mean, and the maximum and minimum ranges. The
area viewed is calculated using both the range and the horizontal field of
view. This viewed area was then combined with fish-count data to generate
fish densities. Count data were provided from Rasmuson et al. [-@rasmuson2020].
As expected, the viewed range has a large effect on the calculated density,
with larger ranges resulting in a lower density of fish. There is
no way to know which range model most accurately reflects the true density of
fish, and thus, multiple range estimates were combined into a single density
estimate using a weighted arithmetic mean. Although the arithmetic mean is
simpler and more intuitive, the fact that the area viewed increases
exponentially suggests a geometric mean may be more appropriate. As an
alternative to the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean density was calculated
three ways to address the zeros in the data. Abundance
estimates (numbers of fish) were calculated by multiplying the density
estimate by an estimate of the habitat area. Coastwide habitat area was
limited to primary or secondary habitat containing hard substrate. The
western boundary was defined as the 200 m contour based on the depth of the
continental shelf-break. The eastern boundary was based on the shallowest
lander observation for each species. `r utils_name("Common")` were
observed on lander video in water as shallow as 4 m; therefore, the 0 m
contour was used. It should be noted that, while the depth range of the
lander surveys conducted by \gls{odfw} extends to 212 m, the majority of
lander surveys have been conducted in either nearshore rocky reefs or at
Stonewall Bank \gls{rca} on the central Oregon coast.

Abundance estimates for the coastwide survey area are provided for
`r utils_name("common")` derived from each of the nine density estimates; five
range models, the weighted arithmetic mean, and three weighted geometric mean
methods. For `r utils_name("common")`, density estimates ranged from
0.020 ± 0.052 (no. fish / m2 ± SD) from the maximum range method to
0.793 ± 1.850 for the third geometric mean method.
The estimated habitat area was 1,940 thousands of km2.
Abundance estimates ranged from 38.8 ± 100.8 (millions of fish ± SD)
to 1,537 ± 3,585. Estimates of abundance from the five range
models produced similar results to the weighted arithmetic mean, ranging from
38.8 ± 100.8 (millions of fish ± SD) for the maximum range to 170.5 ± 472.8
for the minimum range. These were generally considered more plausible than
the results based on the geometric means. Caveats to this abundance
estimate are provided in the detailed document, as well as
considerations for using the lander data and the estimation of habitat area.
