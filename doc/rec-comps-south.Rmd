<!--- RECREATIONAL COMP INFORMATION STARTS HERE -->

Recreational fishery length compositions (Figures \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-sexed} and \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-unsexed}) were obtained directly from MRFSS for years 1980 - 2003 and from CRFS for years 2004 - 2020 from the RecFIN website. RecFIN samples from Mexico were excluded from analysis. Lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) prior to being released (Type 3d data) were also obtained from 2003 to 2020 from CDFW. A number of historical datasets that sampled the recreational fishery were also obtained from the CDFW. These include onboard party boat samples in the 1970's and 1986-1988, CCRS dockside sampling between 1977-1986, dockside party boat and skiff samples from 1959-1972, and onboard party boat sampling from 1987-1998. Sampling data from 1987-1998 (@Reillyetal_1998) was included as an index within the assessment and so separate length composition data were provided for this fleet (Figure \ref{fig:debWV-lencomp-unsexed}). Length composition data collected by CalPoly (n = 5,501) between 2003 and 2019 were also considered. These samples were part of CCFPR sampling but were similar in length to other length samples from RecFIN and were not used.

[PROBABLY COULD USE BETTER DESCRIPTION FOR HISTORICAL DATA AND DEBWV and CALPOLY - CAN LOOK TO PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT AND DEPENDS SOMEWHAT ON WHAT IS WRITTEN FOR INDICES]

Annual recreational length- and distributions were developed following the same bin structure as was used for data from fishery-independent sources. Many of these composition data lack information on the number of fish sampled out of those landed in a given trip, and therefore composition data are used without expansion to the sample level. Unexpanded recreational composition data are commonly used in West Coast stock assessments for the above reason. Samples sizes used in the model were therefore set at the number of fish sampled for each year and data set. Table \ref{tab:sample-size-length} show the sample sizes for lengths. 

Only landed fish were included in composition data. Fish designated as released were excluded from length compositions. This occurred for 9,065 samples, which represent approximately 10 percent of the total samples.
