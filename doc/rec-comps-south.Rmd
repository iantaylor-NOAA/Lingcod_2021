<!--- RECREATIONAL COMP INFORMATION STARTS HERE -->

Recreational fishery length compositions (Figures \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-sexed} 
and \ref{fig:ca-lencomp-unsexed}) were obtained directly from MRFSS for years 
1980 - 2003 and from CRFS for years 2004 - 2020 from the RecFIN website. 
RecFIN samples from Mexico were excluded from analysis. Lengths of fish 
measured by samplers onboard CPFVs 
prior to being released (Type 3d data) were also obtained from 2003 to 2020 
from CDFW. A number of historical datasets that sampled the recreational 
fishery were also obtained from the CDFW. These include lingcod samples from onboard 
observers on CPFVs in 1975-1978 (n = 832) and in 1984-1989
(n = 865) from southern California, dockside sampling within the California Cooperative Rockfish survey 
(CCRS) between 1977-1985 from party/charter 
vessels (n = 692) in central California, dockside samples from party/charter (n = 4,818) 
and skiff vessels (n = 4,307) from 1959-1972 in central
California that focused on lingcod and Blue rockfish (*Sebastes mystinus*) sampling, 
and onboard observers on CPFV's in 1987-1998 (n = 8,668) from central California.
The CPFV data from 1975-1979 were compiled by Rob Collins and Steve Crooke 
from the California Department of Fish and Game, and the data from 1984-1989 were compiled by 
Ray Ally and David Ono from California Department of Fish and Game and published
in Ally et al. [-@Ally1991]. The dockside CCRS data are described in [@Mason_caHist_1995] and [@Mason_rockfishHist_1998], and the dockside data from 1959 to 1972 are described in [@Karpov1995]. The CPFV data from 1987-1998 (@Reillyetal_1998) were included as an index \@ref(lingcod_DebWV_onboard_writeup_NCA.pdf) 
within the assessment and so 
length composition data from this dataset were separated out from the other recreational
data sources (Figure \ref{fig:debWV-lencomp-unsexed}). 

Length composition data collected by California Polytechnic State University 
(Cal Poly; n = 5,501) between 2003 and 2019 were also considered. These 
samples were part of CCFPR sampling and were similar in length to other length samples from RecFIN. Given
the overlap in sampling years, these data were not used, consistent with the previous assessment.

Annual recreational length compositions were developed following the same bin structure as was used for data from fishery-independent sources. Many of these composition data lack information on the number of fish sampled out of those landed in a given trip, and therefore composition data are used without expansion to the sample level. Unexpanded recreational composition data are commonly used in West Coast stock assessments for the above reason. Samples sizes used in the model were therefore set at the number of fish sampled for each year and dataset. Table \ref{tab:sample-size-length} show the sample sizes for lengths. No
ages were available from these recreational data sources. 

Only landed fish were included in composition data. Fish designated as released were excluded from length compositions. This occurred for 9,065 samples, which represent approximately 10 percent of the total samples.
