### Discard rates

Discard rates were modeled for the commercial fisheries only (TW and FG)
using data from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).
This program is part of the NWFSC and has been recording discard observations
starting in 2002. Since 2011, when the IFQ program was implemented,
observer coverage rates increased to nearly 100 percent for all the
limited entry trawl vessels in the program and discard rates 
for the trawl fishery declined compared to pre-2011 rates. 
Discard rates were obtained for both the
IFQ catch-share (observed and electronic monitored vessels) and
the non-catch share sector for `r spp`. A single aggregated annual
discard rate for each fleet was calculated by weighting discard rates 
from three sectors within each gear group:
catch-shares, non-catch-shares, and electronic monitoring, where 
the weights were based on the commercial landings by each sector.

The variances of the total discard estimates were calculated
for the non-catch shares sector and pre-catch share years by 
bootstrapping vessels within ports because the observer program 
randomly chooses vessels within ports to be observed. 
Post trawl rationalization, all catch-share vessels (including
electronic monitoring) have 100 percent 
observer coverage and discarding from the catch-share subset of the fleet
is assumed to be known.

The variance of the aggregated annual discard amount was 
calculated as the sum of the variances of the total annual discard
for each sector under the assumption that the variances
are independent. This variance of the total discard amount 
was then converted to a standard error of the aggregated 
discard rate. The precise discard rates from 2011 onward were
found in initial model runs to be overly influential so a
value of 0.05 was added to the standard error of all discard 
rates to account for unmodeled variability in the retention 
process rather than add additional parameters representing 
that annual variability.
