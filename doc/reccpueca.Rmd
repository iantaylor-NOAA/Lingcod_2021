#### California recreational indices

Please see the provided pdf documents for information regarding
each of the California recreational indices that were
analyzed for their inclusion into this stock assessment.

In short, 
From 1980 to 2003 the \gls{mrfss} program conducted dockside intercept surveys of 
recreational \gls{cpfv} fishing fleet. No \gls{mrfss} \gls{cpue} data are available for the years 
1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. 
For purposes of this assessment, the \gls{mrfss} time series was truncated at 1999 due 
to sampling overlap with the 
onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while 
onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for 
the same vessel). 

Catch and effort data from CRFS dockside sampling of private boats, 2004-2018, 
were provided by \gls{cdfw} for use in this assessment. The data include catch (number 
of fish) by species, number of anglers (i.e. effort units are angler trips), 
angler-reported distance from shore, (Area.X: inside/outside of 3 nm, county, port, 
interview site, year, month, and CRFS district.

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling 
program in 1999 [@Monk2014]. 
\Gls{calpoly} has conducted an independent onboard sampling 
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows 
the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998]. 
During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the \gls{cpfv} and records 
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset 
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a 
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather 
to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and 
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures 
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter 
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for lingcod. 
\gls{calpoly} has modified protocols  reflect sampling changes that \gls{cdfw} 
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at 
the level of a fisherâ€™s bag. Therefore, the \gls{calpoly} data area incorporated in 
the same index as the \gls{cdfw} data from 1999-2019.  The only difference is that 
\gls{calpoly} measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either 
\gls{cdfw} or \gls{calpoly} in 2020.

As described above the \gls{cdfw} and \gls{calpoly} onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that \gls{calpoly}
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and \gls{cdfw}
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. \gls{cdfw} measures retained 
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index 
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational 
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) 
fish.  Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length 
from \gls{cdfw} sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and included in the 
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model. 

The California Collaborative Fisheries Research Project, [CCFRP](https://www.mlml.calstate.edu/ccfrp/), 
is a fishery-independent 
hook-and-line survey designed to monitor nearshore fish populations at a series of sampling 
locations both inside and adjacent to \glspl{mpa} along the central California coast 
[@Wendt2009; @Starr2015].  The CCFRP survey began in 2007 and was originally
designed as a statewide program in collaboration with NMFS scientists and fishermen. 
From 2007-2016 the CCFRP project was focused on the central California coast, and has monitored 
four \glspl{mpa} consistently.  In 2017, 
the program was expanded coastwide within California.  The index of abundance was 
developed from the four \glspl{mpa} sampled consistently,
A&ntilde;o Nuevo and Point Lobos by Moss Landing Marine Labs;
Point Buchon and Piedras Blancas by \gls{calpoly}.

### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted 
by \gls{cdfw} survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, [@Reilly1998]). During an onboard 
observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific 
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers 
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 
people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be 
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location.  The sampler 
also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting 
and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices 
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.
A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database [@Monk2016].
