## Summary of Management History and Performance

### Commercial Fishery

Prior to 1977, `r spp` stocks in the northeast Pacific were managed by the
Canadian Government within its waters and
by the individual states in waters (out to three miles) off of the U.S.
With implementation of the \gls{msfcma} in 1976,
primary responsibility for the management of the groundfish stocks off
Washington, Oregon, and California shifted from the states to the \gls{pfmc}.
The U.S. west coast \gls{abc} for `r spp`  was set at 7,000 mt,
but catch was consistently below this level.
In 1994, a \gls{hg} of 4,000 mt was set.
In 1995, both the \gls{abc} and \gls{hg} were dropped to 2,400 mt
based on a quantitative assessment [@jagielo2000assessment].

**todo - add information about minimum size limits for commercial fishery**
Trip limits on commercial `r spp` catch were first instituted in 1995,
when a 20,000 lbs/month limit was imposed.
In 1998, a two-month cumulative limit of 1,000 lbs was imposed.
Since then, management of the fishery has occurred through
individual-year \gls{abc} and \gls{oy} levels.

The \gls{pfmc} implemented an initial `r spp` Rebuilding Plan in 2000
with size and seasonal limitations in the recreational fishery and
a change to limited entry and open access sectors in the commercial fishery.
Additionally, the coastwide \gls{abc} was reduced
from 960 mt to 700 mt.
In the commercial fishery sector, \glspl{hg} in 2000 were reduced by over 80\%
from 1998 limits.
To achieve these low harvest goals,
all commercial fishing for `r spp`  was closed for six months
(January to April and November to December).
During the open period between April and November,
all commercial vessels were limited to 400 lbs per month and
non-trawl vessels had a minimum size limit of

26 in south of Cape Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N) and
24 in to the north of Cape Mendocino.

Between 2000 and 2005, while the fishery was rebuilding,
cumulative trip limits were very low, at 800 lbs bimonthly,
with frequent closures.
After 2006, \glspl{abc} and trip limits were increased,
with a bimonthly limit of 1,200 lbs.
Concurrently, \glspl{mpa} in California,
\glspl{rca} and the \gls{cca} were established.
In these areas, take of all groundfish is prohibited within specified
depths, habitats, and locations.

**todo - perhaps add more information to this paragraph**
Between 2002 and 2011, observed trips were chosen by random stratified sampling.
In 2011, the limited entry trawl sector became a catch share program
with 100\% observer coverage.

### Recreational Fishery

Recreational regulations for `r spp` were established in 1994 and included
a bag limit of three fish in Washington and Oregon,
a bag limit of five fish in California, and
a minimum size limit of 22 in in Washington and California.
The 22 in minimum size limit was adopted in Oregon in 1995 and
increased to 24 in in all three states in 1998.
In 1998, the bag limit in Washington and California dropped to two fish per day.
Oregon followed suite in 1999, and
the two-fish bag limit largely remained coastwide until 2008.

Between 2000 and 2004,
the California recreational bag limit dropped to 1 fish per day and
the size limit increased from 26 to 30 in.
Oregon's bag limit fluctuated between one and two fish per day.
Regulations have become less restrictive since the rebuilding period.
In 2015, the bag limit increased to 3 fish per day in California,
while the two-fish bag limit was retained in Oregon and Washington.
A size limit of 22 in was adopted in all three states.
More recently, the bag limit in California has decreased to 2 fish per day.
In Oregon, there have been multiple recreational groundfish in-season closures
to reduce impacts to overfished rockfish.
