# selectivity specifications
*As of 10pm on 15 June 2021, these changes haven't yet made it into the model*

Selectivity was modeled using the double-normal function of length
(option 24 in Stock Synthesis) with 3 of the 6 possible parameters estimated 
for each fleet.
The estimated parameters controlled the length at peak selectivity, the slope of the 
ascending limb and the slope of the descending limb (parameters 1, 3, and 4 in SS). 
The parameter controlling the width of the top was fixed at a small value (-15)
to make a smooth transition from ascending to descending with no flat top. 
Parameters 5 and 6 which control additional scaling of initial and final values
were not used (via the -999 code in SS).

Changes in selectivity and retention over time were modeled to account for 
management changes and gear changes.

## North model
*Commercial trawl*
Time period of blocking on selectivity parameters were retained from 
the 2017 assessment. These included changes in
1973
1983
1993
2003
2011 (implementation of the catch shares program)

Additionally, there were retention changes modeled in the following years,
also retained from the 2017 assessment.
1998 
2007
2010
2011 (implementation of the catch shares program)
where prior to 1998, all selected fish are assumed to be retained in keeping
with comments from those familiar with the history of the commercial fishery 
at the at the pre-assessment workshop and the Pikitch study in which 
more than 99% of the observed Lingcod were retained

*Commercial fixed-gear*
1998 
2011 (implementation of the catch shares program)

*recreational Washington*
1987
1995
1998
1999
2000
2001
2007
2011
2017 (22‚Äù minimum size requirement was lifted from July 2017 to current for all catch areas but the change happened in the middle of the year)

*recreational Oregon*
1995 (the first year with a minimum size limit--22 inches)
1998 (min size limit was increased to 24 inches)
2007 (min size limit was reduced from 24 to 22 inches)

Not accounted for is a max size limit in place for one year only (2000) of 34 inches, as the absence of larger fish observed in a single year was assumed to have a negligible impact on the model results.

*recreational California*
1999 minimum size limit imposed

## South model
*Commercial trawl*
Time period of blocking on selectivity parameters were retained from 
the 2017 assessment. These included changes in
1973
1983
1993
2003
2011

Additionally, there were retention changes modeled in the years
1998 
2007
2010
2011 (implementation of the catch shares program)
where prior to 1998, all selected sizes are assumed to be retained
