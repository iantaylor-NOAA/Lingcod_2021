The fit to the seven indices of abundance are all reasonably good, with 
the timing and magnitude of changes in expected abundance following the 
observed patterns (Figure \ref{fig:index-fits-all-fleets}). 
The five contemporary indices all increased over the 2010s with a peak 
around 2005, which the model expectation fits well driven by a large 2008 cohort. 
The areas with the biggest lack of fit are the first two years of the 
trawl logbook CPUE index, which were much higher than the rest of the time series, 
the 2004 observations of the \gls{s-tri}, and the 2020 observation of 
the Washington recreational CPUE index. All of these observations are 
inconsistent with the adjacent observations in the same index suggesting 
that they may be outlier rather than a signal about the true dynamics of 
the underlying population.

The fit to the length data, when aggregated over time 
(Figure \ref{fig:comp-lenfit--aggregated-across-time}) shows 
some imbalances in the sex ratios but the modes are generally falling in the right
places. The commercial trawl discards show modes associated with 
the length at ages 1 and 2 the first of which is better fit than the second. 
This could be due to the fishery taking places over a protracted season while the model
expectation is based on a mid-year snapshot. Looking at the 
fits for individual years (available in electronic appendix) shows high variability for the 
commercial trawl length comps and a large blotches in the Pearson residuals.
In general, the recreational and survey length compositions are reasonably well fit.

Ages in the north model are all conditioned on length, but also included as
marginal "ghost age comps" ("AgeComp" in electronic appendix) which are excluded 
from the likelihood for purposes of 
visualing the implied fit. These data do not show strong cohorts very clearly,
although some modes progress through the population, such as the 2008 cohort 
as observed by the \gls{s-wcgbt} in the years 2008-2011 (the observed mode in 2012 
is off by 1 year). 

The conditional age-at-length (CAAL, "A\@LComp" in electronic appendix) data 
in the north model are numerous. They represent over 72,000 indivual fish
from a total of 161 fleet/year combinations. In general, most years and most fleets 
show no strong patterns in the Pearson residuals, but there are a few exceptions.
For instance, the commercial trawl fit in 1980 has many fish older than expected
within all of the smaller length bins, while in 1981 the ages observations
all fall in the middle of the expected range. The "Conditional AAL plot" diagnostic
shows that both the mean age in each length bin and the variability in age at length
have a good match for most years and most fleets.

The expected commercial trawl discard fractions ("Discard" in electronic appendix) 
are higher than observed for the period 2002-2009, where
the large uncertainty in estimated discards allows the model to misfit these 
to better fit the length comps, with the parameter for length at 50\% retention
pushed to the upper bound as discussed in Section \ref{sec-model-selection}. 
However, discards prior to 1998 are assumed to be low
and the fits from 2010 onward are good, so the impact of the lack of fit on 
the estimated mortality is limited to a 12-year period. The commercial fixed-gear
discards show less variability over time, are more uncertain, and the fits
are well within the uncertainty intervals for all but 2002.

The fit to the mean body weight ("Mnwt") of discards are good for most years
although the observed discards in the first two years (2002 and 2003) were lighter 
than the expectation. There are no discard length compositions from those years
so it's difficult to judge the reasons for the lack of fit.
