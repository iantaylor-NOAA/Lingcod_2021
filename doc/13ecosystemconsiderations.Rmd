## Ecosystem considerations

Ecosystem considerations were not explicitly included in this analysis.
However, habitat variables were included in some of the models used to
standardize commercial and recreational \gls{cpue} data prior to including
that information as an index in the stock assessment model.
Future work could expand upon that done by Bassett et al. [-@bassett2018lingcod], which 
found that ontogenetic habitat shifts could be an age restriction on the `r spp`
able to benefit from the placement of \glspl{rca} and \glspl{mpa}.

Given the predatory nature of `r spp`, they more than likely influence the natural
mortality of rockfish species that are highly targeted by recreational fishers
[e.g., @beaudreau2007spatial]. When diet data are collected at a sufficient
spatial resolution to inform predatory relationships, the estimated abundance of
`r spp` could be used to inform estimates of time-varying natural mortality for
these longer-lived rockfish species.
