The senstivity analyses were divided into three groups: biology and recruitment,
composition, and indices (Tables \ref{tab:sens-table-s-bio-rec}, 
\ref{tab:sens-table-s-comp}, and
\ref{tab:sens-table-s-index}; Figures \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-bio-rec},
\ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-comp}, and \ref{fig:sens-timeseries-s-index}).

The biology and recruitment senstivities included

- estimate a single $M$ for both sexes with a prior which is a mixture distribution 
of the two priors sex-specific priors in the base model 
(a lognormal with mean = 0.358, sd = 0.467)
- fix $h$ at 0.7
- fix female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7
- increase $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.8
- decrease $\sigma_R$ from 0.6 to 0.4

The composition senstivities included

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
- add all additional ages as CAAL to the south model
- add all additional ages as marginal
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```
```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
- use the "combM+F" option in stock synthesis to ignore sex ratios among small fish
- remove all composition data vectors for unsexed fish (which were already represented
separately from the sexed fish in the base model)
- apply the Dirichlet-Multinomial likelihood to automatically tune the composition 
sample sizes (instead of the Francis method applied in the base model)
```

Additional composition-related sensitivities were conducted in earlier versions of
the model but could not be repeated for the base model in time for inclusion in
this pre-review version of the report.

The index sensitivities involved removing each index from the model as well
as removing all the fishery-dependent indices.

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
[to do: add interpretation for north model sensitivities]
```

```{asis, echo = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "South", TRUE, FALSE)}
Among the biology sensitvities, the south model was most senstive to  
fixing female $M$ at 0.3 and $h$ at 0.7 which pushed the scale up to a high level
with the final 2021 spawning biomass estimated close to $B_0$.

The addition of ages as CAAL or marginal in the south model likewise pushed the 
scale upwards (with the scale of the biomass in the CAAL sensitivity so high that
it doesn't appear within the range shown in the figure). The Dirichlet-Multinomial
sensitivity, which led to increased weight on the length and age compositions
likewise pushed the scale upwards.
