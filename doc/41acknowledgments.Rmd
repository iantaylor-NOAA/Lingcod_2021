# Acknowledgments
Here are all the mad props!

- Chantel Wetzel for her 2021 Dover Sole stock assessment which provided 
a valuable template for many elements in this assessment, as well as 
bailing us out with help at many points in the assessment process,
- Theresa Tsou and the staff at WDFW for answering countless questions 
about data from Washington State, and
- Jim Hastie and John DeVore for providing background on historical 
changes to the groundfish fishery.
