## Previous assessments and reviews

### History of modeling approaches

There have been six assessments of `r spp` since 1986
covering part or all of the West Coast of the U.S.
Adams [-@pfmclingcod1986] conducted a yield per recruit analysis.
Jagielo [-@jagielo1994assessment] conducted an age-structured assessment of the status of the
`r spp` stock between
Cape Falcon in Northern Oregon to
49\textdegree N latitude
(off of southwest Vancouver Island in British Columbia - PMFC areas 3A, 3B, and 3C, including Canada),
using the Stock Synthesis program (Methot, 1990).
Data included trawl and recreational catch from 1979-1993
with equilibrium catch before then,
triennial shelf survey and trawl CPUE indices, and
length- and age-frequency data.
The final spawning output levels were estimated to be about
20\% of pristine levels, and
catch level recommendations ranged between 2500 and 3000 mt
based on F40\% to F20\%.
The 1997 assessment [@jagielo1997assessment] expanded the area
south to Cape Blanco (42\textdegree 50\textquotesingle N latitude) and
retained the northern boundary of 49\textdegree 00\textquotesingle N latitude
using a Stock Synthesis model.
Depletion in spawning output in this model was below 10\% for 1997.
Adams et al. [-@pfmclingcod1999], conducted a length-based, age-structured population model
implemented in AD Model Builder [ADMB; @fournier1996] for the southern area,
which had not yet been assessed (Eureka, Monterey, and Conception INPFC areas).
Jagielo et al. [-@jagielo2000assessment] conducted age structured models in ADMB
for two areas of the U.S.,
U.S. Vancouver-Columbia (no longer including Canadian waters) and
Eureka, Monterey, and Conception INPFC areas.
Jagielo et al. [-@pfmclingcod2003] conducted age structured assessments
for the two areas using Coleraine.
Jagielo et al. [-@pfmclingcod2005] conducted age structured assessments for the two areas
using Stock Synthesis 2.
They found that the northern stock had recovered substantially
from a low point in the 1990s and was at 87\% depletion,
while the southern area had not recovered as well and was at 24\% depletion,
with a 64\% coast-wide depletion.

The 2009 stock assessment, which used Stock Synthesis 2,
divided the northern (Washington and Oregon) and southern (California) stocks
by state line [@hamel2009].
The point estimate for the spawning stock depletion at the start of 2009 was
61.9\% for the northern area, 73.7\% for the southern area,
indicating the stock was recovered.
The axis of uncertainty for the decision table provided to managers was
natural mortality for the north,
with the base model $M$ = 0.18 for females and 0.32 for males.
The “Low M” alternative used $M$ = 0.16 and 0.285 for females and males respectively,
and the “High M” alternative used $M$ = 0.20 and 0.355.
The axis of uncertainty for the South model was for the high alternative including age data,
and for the low alternative excluding the dockside recreational CPUE index.
The 2009 stock assessment removed all age data due to
issues with outliers and possible aging bias.
The northern and southern models were made as equivalent as possible
by keeping fixed and estimated parameters largely the same for the two assessments.
Natural mortality was fixed at 0.18 for females and 0.32 for males in both assessments,
while stock-recruitment steepness was fixed at 0.8.
