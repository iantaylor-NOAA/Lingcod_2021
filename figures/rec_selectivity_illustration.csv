"Illustration of the effective selectivity associated with retained recreational catch (upper panel) and the difference in expected proportion at length between retained-only (as used in the model), and retained plus dead discards (unavailable due to the nature of the sampling process). Selectivity, retention, and numbers-at-length are based on the California recreational fishery in the 2017 south model for the year 2000.","Illustration of the effective selectivity associated with retained recreational catch and the difference in expected proportion at length between retained-only and retained plus dead discards.","selectivity","../figures/rec_selectivity_illustration.png"
