"Estimates of species coefficients (blue bars) from the binomial generalized linear model (GLM) for presence/absence of lingcod in the Washington recreational dockside interview data. Horizontal black bars represent the 95\% confidence intervals.","Halibut and blue are the most and least likely species to co-occur with lingcod in the Washington recreational fishery.","reccpuewa-filterSMcoef","../figures/reccpuewa-filterSMcoef.png"
