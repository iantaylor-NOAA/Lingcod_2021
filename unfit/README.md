# lingcod_2021/unfit

This directory stores information relevant to this assessment
but is not currently being used to create data.
Data is a loose term here that can include anything imported into the assessment.
Items in unfit may include files that store
R code, manipulated data, or any other item you are working on
but is not ready to go mainstream.
For example, you might have an R script that has many helpful notes
but will not work on other people's machines or was just done for exploration.
All of this information is helpful and will lead to less work for future
team members, so take the plunge and commit it to unfit.
