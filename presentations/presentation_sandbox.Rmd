# STAR Request 12

Process: start by simplifying the selectivity parameterization and and then add back additional
parameters, including sex-specific offsets in order to find a good balance between 
adequate fits to the data, reasonable selectivity shapes, and reasonable overall results.

The north base model has several fixed parameters controlling dome-shaped selectivity,
all these were freed up before the explorations to allow things to become domed as needed.

No re-tuning was done.

413_asymptotic_TW | fix the commercial trawl selectivity to be asymptotic for all blocks 
414_descend_shared_across_blocks | make the descending slope of the selectivity function equal for all blocks 
415_sex_sel_descend_shared | make the descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific and equal for all blocks 
416_descend_shared_rec | make the descending slope of the selectivity function equal for all blocks within the rec fleets 
417_sex_sel_descend_shared_rec | make the descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific and equal for all blocks within the rec fleets  
419_sex_sel_descend | make the descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific
420_sex_sel_scale_descend_fisheries | make the scale and descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific for fisheries only
421_sex_sel_peak_descend_fisheries | make the peak and descending slope of the selectivity function sex-specific for fisheries only
