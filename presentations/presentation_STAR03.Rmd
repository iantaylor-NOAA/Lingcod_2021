### Outline

This presentation will focus on three things:

- key diagnostics that were instrumental in the model selection process

- a subset of the sensitivities which provide useful information about the base models

- comparison of results for north and south models

More detailed model results and fits to data can be explored as needed using
the materials posted to https://iantaylor-noaa.github.io/Lingcod_2021/

### 2017 STAR panel recommendations

--

1. Cross-validate age-readings among labs and year

2. Acquire information from Canadian and Mexican authorities

3. Investigate stock structure

4. Concern for ages of unsexed fish being assigned equally to the sexes without regard for length

3. Perform a spatially-explicit stock assessment model

5. Fixed length at age 14 in North model

6. Estimate other key parameters, namely $M$ and $h$

7. Estimate area of habitat per area

Profiles before and after removing age data provided insight into what parts of the data were informative.

---

.large[.pink[Correlation of <br> Bayesian posteriors]]
<br>
- Estimate posteriors using MCMC

- Autocorrelation
  - typically removed with thinning
  - more autocorrelation means higher uncertainty
  - effective sample size / number of samples quantifies 'mixing'
  - thinning will not help poorly defined models

- Identify inefficient parameters

### Sensitivity analyses

---

### North sensitivity to biology and recruitment
.pull-left-30[
- North model was not sensitive to most of these changes
- Largest change came from fixing female M = 0.3 and h = 0.7
- Base model estimates were M = 0.41 and h = 0.80
]

.pull-right-70[

### South sensitivity to biology and recruitment

.pull-left-30[
- South model was not sensitive to most of these changes
- Largest change came from fixing female M = 0.3 and h = 0.7
- Base model estimates were M = 0.26 and h = 0.54

      kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 12) 
`

### North sensitivity to composition data

.pull-left-40[
- Dirichlet-multinomial likelihood:
  - increased weight on all comps
  - reduced fit to survey
  - reduced differentiation in weights among fleets

### South sensitivity to composition data

.pull-left-40[
- South model was sensitive to most changes in comp data
- D-M likelihood again increased comp weights
- Adding more age data pushed scale to implausibly high levels

### South sensitivity to index changes

.pull-left-40[

### Additional sensitivities: selectivity & retention

An additional set of senstivities not included in the assessment reports:

1. make commercial fixed-gear fleet have asympotic selectivity
<br>(south only as north already had FG estimated asymptotic)

2. add an offset parameter to estimate sex-specific selectivity

3. sex-specific selectivity + fix female _M_ at 0.3

4. model retention prior to 1998 as equal to the current era (2011-onward) rather 
than retaining almost 100% of all fish

---

### North sensitivity to selectivity & retention

.pull-left-30[
- little sensitivity to retention assumption

- bigger impact of sex-specific selectivity (more details to follow)
]

<!-- to do: move selelectivity and retention figs into docs and add to HTML -->

### North & South sensitivity to retention
.pull-left-40[
- Assuming early and late retention are equal has bigger impact on 
south model where discard rates are higher
- Estimated selectivity for the south in the early period is less plausible
with higher retention

### Conclusions on selectivity & retention

- They provide useful information about tensions within the base models

- They show confounding between ratio of female to male _M_ and female to male
selectivity

- Some parameter estimates seem less plausible in each case

- None of these additional models appears as reasonable as the base models

### Comparison of areas: key parameters

.pull-left-40[
- Sex-specific natural mortality $M$ estimated with separate priors in both models
- Stock-recruit steepness $h$ estimated with informative prior for both models
- North model estimates associated with a more productive stock:
  - greater length-at-age (also more precisely estimated), 
  - higher $M$, and 
  - higher $h$

]

### Comparison of areas: quantities of interest
.pull-left-40[
- Unfished biomass more similar than would be expected given relative area
of the two regions
- Rough estimate is ~2.3x larger area in the north
- Fishing intensity in 2020 is similar in both regions
- Fraction unfished in 2021 is greater in the north than the south and more
precisely estimated
- MSY significantly larger in the north than the south

### Concluding comments

- Both lingcod models are complex and challenging to understand individually
and in comparison with each other

- The base models resolve many of the issues raised in previous STAR panel
but raise new questions for future research

- Model scale is sensitive to a variety of assumptions

- Models fit indices well, indicating that we will be able to track changes in abundance

- Data suggest that the south is less productive than the north 

- Assuming equal values for mortality and steepness results in less 
plausible relative scale of the two models

- On the whole, both models should provide useful tools for managing these stocks
